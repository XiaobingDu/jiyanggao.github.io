## About Me
I'm currently a PhD candidate at University of Southern California, advised by Prof. Ram Nevatia. My research focus on computer vision, especially activity detection, temporal reasoning and video analysis. I obtained my B.S. degree from Tsinghua University in 2015. I did internship at Sensetime in 2015 and at Google Research during 2017 summer, I will spend 2018 summer at Google Cloud AI.
